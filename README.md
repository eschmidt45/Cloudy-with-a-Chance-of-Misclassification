Cloudy with a Chance of Misclassification: An Exploration of Methods on Arctic Satellite Imagery

Overview:

The goal of this project was explore data through a number of classification methods, and ultimately build a model designed to detect clouds in polar regions from MISR data provided by the NASA satellite Terra. This project consisted of four main phases: the data exploration phase, preparation phase, modeling phase, and diagnostics phase. We implemented this process on the MISR data of three images offered by the paper "Daytime Arctic Cloud Detection Based on Multi-Angle Satellite Data with Case Studies". In this file will be provided an in depth description of how to reproduce our project in its entirety. 

Phase 1: Data Exploration

To begin our analysis of the data at hand we first simply calculated the percentage of data points that fell into each of the three classifications (cloudy, not-cloudy, and unlabled) for the three images. From there we created ggpairs plots on the first 2000 data points of the three images, using all but the x and y coordinate features. We proceeded to the creation of geom_tile plots for the three images that mapped the data points by x and y coordinate and colored them by classification. To gain better understanding of the correlation we sampled 10,000 data points from each image and used these samples to create corr.plots. Next we produced eight geom_boxplots that described each of the following features (NDAI, SD, CORR, DF, CF, BF, AF, AN) individually by label. This concluded our Data Exploration Phase.

Phase 2: Preparation

The initial step to our Preparation Phase was to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The first split we tried was a 60/20/20 split for the training, validation, and testing sets respectively. To achieve this we sampled 60% of the data points from each image and allocated the points to our trainings sets, next we sampled 50% of the remaining data from each image (20% of the total) and allocated this data to our validation sets, and the remaining data for each image was allocated to our test sets. The next split we create was a spin of 60/20/20 split, where this time we sampled equal rates of each classification type. That is we grouped the classification types and sampled 60% of each classification type for the three images and allocated these points to our training sets, then sampled 20% from each classification type of each image, to create both our validation and test sets. For the remainder of the paper, code, and this document the first split mentioned will be referred to as the method one split, and the second split mentioned will be referred to as the method two split. Moving to the next step of our Preparation phase we assessed the accuracy of the trivial classifier, setting all labels equal to negative one for each image. Next we used the training data from the method two split, to perform PCA analysis. We first performed the analysis on the radiance features (DF, CF, BF, AF, and AN) and made two geom_point plots for the first/second and thrid/fourth PCA directions. We then repeated this process for the non-radiance features (NDAI, SD, and CORR). Finally, agian with the method two training data, we created thre geom_point scatterplots to further understand Labels across DF vs. SD, Labels across CORR vs. NDAI, and Labels across XCoord vs. YCoord.
